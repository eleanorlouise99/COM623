<h2>About</h2>
<p>This repositary includes the files needed to view the Sport Solent SPA that I have created as part of my second assignment for COM623. This is an application built with react that is aimed at solent students to help them get more details regarding the sports clubs at the unis and the events that they are hosting.<br>

The app consists of 3 main pages as well as a login/sign up screen. The pages are: a homepage, which includes cards for the individuals clubs and societies at Solent, and by clicking on american football, this should take you to the second page which is a society page for american football. The final page can be found by clicking on the online social event card on the society page, this will take you to the individual event page.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>To install this locally:</p>

<ul>

<p>And your ready to play around with or view the app!</p>
